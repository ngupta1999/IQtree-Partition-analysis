# IQtree-Partition-analysis
## What's that for ?
 To figure out the best partition model using IQtree and compare with the an unpartitioned model
## How to carry out the analysis ?
  Perform partitioning  on the cognato.nexus file(contains both alignment and patition file) using the command line mentioned in the Modelfinder file.
  ### Results 
   As per the partiton file the best fit models per partitions were determined(Since three partitions were made in the partition file)
   1. MK+FQ+I+G4
   2. MK+FQ+I+G4
   3. MK+FQ+R4
   
   AICc Score: 74695.2448 
   
   The AICc value for the above case was found to be less than that of un partitioned model(74950.4333) 
   
   In the tree analysis of the cases Tree Length and Sum of the Intrnal Branches was found to be more in Partitinoned model by the Modelfinder
